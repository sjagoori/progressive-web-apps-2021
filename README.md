## 📝The concept
The main objective of this project is to render data from an API endpoint so, given what is required, I've picked the topic of cryptocurrency. Specifically the pricing and general information along with the contact information of each. For the data I will use CoinmarketCap's API, you can find their documentation [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/). The landing of this concept will display a top list of cryptocurrencies based on their market cap. Once selected, it brings you to a detail page where you will find additional information. The used endpoints for this project are `/listings` for the top lists and `/info` for the additional infomation for each coin in the toplist. 


## 🤖 Installation
**Run the project:**
1. Install dependencies
`npm install`
2. Run project
`npm run start`

# Progressive Web Apps @cmda-minor-web · 20-21

In this course we will convert the client side web application previously made Web App From Scratch into a server side rendered application. We also add functionalities based on the Service Worker and turn the application into a Progressive Web App. Ultimately we are going to implement a series of optimisations to improve the performance of the application.  

## Learning goals
- _You understand the difference between client side and server side rendering and you can apply server side rendering
in your application_
- _You understand how a Service Worker works and you can implement it in your application._
- _You understand how the critical render path works and how you can optimize it for a better runtime and / or perceived performance._
